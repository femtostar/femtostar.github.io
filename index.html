    <h2>Satellite communications built for privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The FemtoStar Project  wants to develop a low-cost communications satellite
        (or, eventually, a communications satellite constellation) for global data
        communications, with end-to-end encryption, with minimal ability to determine the
        user's location, and powered by free software, from the user terminal, to the
        spacecraft, to the ground station. We've named our design FemtoStar.
    </p>
    <p>
        We're a small team of developers and hardware guys, not a startup company. We have
        no funding at this point, and don't intend to seek it until we need it. We want
        to involve the privacy community in every step of the process.
    </p>

        If you're interested, shoot us a Reddit message at /u/FemtoStar, or email us
        securely, at [the name of this site/our satellite] at tutanota.com.
