<h1>FemtoStar</h1>
<h2>Satellite communications built for privacy</h2>
The FemtoStar Project  wants to develop a low-cost communications satellite<br> 
(or, eventually, a communications satellite constellation) for global data<br>
communications, with end-to-end encryption, with minimal ability to determine the<br>
user's location, and powered by free software, from the user terminal, to the<br>
spacecraft, to the ground station. We've named our design FemtoStar.<br><br>

We're a small team of developers and hardware guys, not a startup company. We have<br> 
no funding at this point, and don't intend to seek it until we need it. We want<br>
to involve the privacy community in every step of the process.<br><br>

If you're interested, shoot us a Reddit message at /u/FemtoStar, or email us<br>
securely, at [the name of this site/our satellite] at tutanota.com.
