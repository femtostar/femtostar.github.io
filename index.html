    <h2>Satellite communications built for privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The FemtoStar Project  wants to develop a low-cost communications satellite
        (or, eventually, a communications satellite constellation) for global data
        communications, with end-to-end encryption, with minimal ability to determine the
        user's location, and powered by free software, from the user terminal, to the
        spacecraft, to the ground station. We've named our design FemtoStar, and written
        a <a href="femtostar.pdf">document explaining the proposed system</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We're a small team of developers and hardware guys, not a startup company. We want
        to involve the privacy community in every step of the process.
